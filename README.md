# DuneMUD

This repo contains a small bit of code I've done / am currently working on for
DuneMUD. This is a game that was first brought online back in 1992, and has maintained
a dedicated playerbase for almost 30 years now. The game is played over Telnet (like other
MUDs/MUSHes/MOOs etc), and the codebase is written in LPC, a specialized flavor of C written
specifically for MUDs.

Play now!

telnet://dunemud.net:6788

or from CLI:

telnet dunemud.net 6789

If you're using Mudlet or Tinyfugue (or any other client that supports TLS):

dunemud.net 6788
