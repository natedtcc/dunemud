There's a large, angry chef at the Tleilax Hospital who's been
getting bad batches of spice lately. You hear that the residents
of the Hospital have been getting even sicker, and the tainted
spice is likely to blame. The chef will reward anyone who can
provide him with a clean product. Can you find the pure, liquid
spice stashed away within the Hospital grounds?
