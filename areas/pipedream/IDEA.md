Sapho-pipe-toke-trip-maze-thingie Ideas:


- When the pipe is smoked, player gets moved to beginning of maze
- Their body is replaced with a dummy (no kill maybe?)

- Area should be pretty decent size, thinking maybe 80 rooms
- Lots of weird trippy colourful spam in room descs

- 3 mobtypes - small, medium, big - 3/4 variations per type
- Colourful attacks and spam

- Different entrances (awaken in a coffin, in a mirror, in combat etc)

- 5 keys to get out of the area (or to the boss)
- Keybearers are somewhat hidden / in special rooms
- Keybearers are stronger mobs

- Players can 'awaken' but lose all progress and items they gained (money too)
