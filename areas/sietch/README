*Fremen Sietch / Living Sietch Upgrade*
***************************************


This area was written by Juris.
The original area is left intact.
/d/Fremen/juris/sietch/


The Fremen Sietch is essentially split into two; the main
area, and the living sietch area. I tried to keep most of
the main area intact (mostly because it houses a quest mob),
while making use of the large (empty) space found in the 
living sietch.

The mobs in the main area are exactly the same as before,
with the exception that their armour has been upgraded and
their numbers have increased slightly. The quest mob is located
in this area - I tidy'd up the mob (/npc/wisfrem.c), gave him
a 'listen' command for more quest details, added an explorer
point to the quest, and made sure the quest rewards are given
properly.

The mobs in the living sietch have gotten a massive upgrade,
and are now hovering around level 650-700+. They also have 
pretty high combat skills (2000 in all defense and crysknife!).
I also beefed them up with Mreh's combat commands, as well as
playing with set_bonus_attack to get more hits out of the.
Also, before my upgrade, there were typically only a few mobs
(most likely because Juris used a daemon to control population,
but it was in fact not functional), however now there are roughly
150 mobs in this area, and the daemon has been removed. All mobs
are spawned from one fremen object.
See /sietch/npc/fremen.c && /sietch/include/defines.h for more info

Additionally, the quest has been added to the quest list. it
was never actually listed (afaik), and it was through sheer
luck I found it while playing a couple years back. Not sure
why it missed the list to begin with - it seems like it was
put together by Sauron (blame him).

Other than that, I just did a bit of modernizing. This is an
old(er) area, so many rooms had ::reset(arg) missing or used
legacy stuff like set_al(). Tidy'd up as much as I could, but
there's a fuckton of typos. I'll leave that in, 'tis DuneMUD
after all. :)
